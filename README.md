## Introduction

Rajio is an anonymous file/text sharing platform on web, focusing on lightweight and easy-deploy.

Just similar to [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), Rajio gives you a space to upload file or text without login and your privacy. **Rajio will not encrypt your file on the server, which is different from Firefox Send**. After uploading, you can share it with your friends by urls or qrcode. The original intention of rajio is only to find an easy way to transfer a file from my PC to my phones without any other software installed.
